Using Runge-Kuttah algorithm to solve a wide variety of differential equations


Numerical techniques are clever algorithms created by clever SCIENSTISTS to solve differnt topics in maths but this is just part of the story as this algorithms could go into complex loops where 
precision and accuracy are essential if we want results close to the ones from the classical analytical methods and that is what computers are all about solving stuff fast and in magical accuracy. So in this mini project I will use Python's Tkintrer library to implemnt such algorithm into living scripts.
